# Chakra UI - basic design system test
In this simple front-end application i'm using:

- NextJS (to server side rendering)
- Chakra UI (to make an customized design system flow)
- TypeScript 
- ReactJS

The intent to this little app is to know and explore some approaches
from SSR and Design System.
